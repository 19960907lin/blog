Q: What are the next targets of CyberMiles regarding adoption?

A: There is actually a main objective we are trying to achieve. Launched by a group of enthusiasts, we are revolutionizing e-commerce-a decentralized peer-to-peer marketplace. To make it simple, we are building the infrastructure of an e-commerce marketplace on our blockchain to enable its governance to be fully managed by its customers and community, who will decide what products can be listed and who can sell them. Such a marketplace popularity will certainly grow proportionally, with CMT as one of the major payment methods. We believe this will highly contribute to CMT's adoption.
