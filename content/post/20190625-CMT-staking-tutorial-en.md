[CyberMiles App](http://onelink.to/v248ze) (formerly CMT Wallet) 3.0 enables staking function today!!! Hooray! Now CMT holders can get block award by staking with mobile App!

After the mainnet upgrade, the main factors for block award calculation are:

1. Total staked amount in the whole CyberMiles network.

2. The validator’s compensation rate. The lower the remuneration rate, the better for the staker (delegator).

3. Your staked CMT amount. the higher the amount, the higher the block award.

4. The staking method being CMT Cube or CyberMiles App. Under the same conditions, the CMT Cube’s staking award is 20% higher than the CyberMiles App and will maintain this rate until April 2020.

* Important: CMT Cube users can import the address of CMT Cube into CyberMiles App, but please do not stake on CMT Wallet. Once you stake with CyberMiles App using the Cube address, the system will identify that the address belongs to a CyberMiles App. You can no longer enjoy the 20% bonus of the CMT Cube.

Deposit a certain amount of CMTs to the CyberMiles App. (1000 CMTs and above)

*Each CMT Wallet can stake at least 1,000 CMTs and can stake up to 100,000 CMTs. You can choose to create multiple wallet addresses for voting.
