The [FairPlay smart contract](https://github.com/CyberMiles/smart_contracts/blob/master/FairPlay/FairPlay.lity) enables anyone to create a prize drawing of anything -- digital products, physical merchandise, anything that can be sold via e-commerce. FairPlay prize drawing is fair, fully automated, transparent, and decentralized.  All you need is the [CMT Wallet](https://cybermiles.io/blockchain-infrastructure/cmt-wallet/) mobile application. You do not need CMTs or any other cryptocurrency to participate.

* *Fair*: The drawing is done by a random number generator in the CyberMiles Virtual Machine. The [secure random number generator](https://www.litylang.org/rand/) is a key innovation of CyberMiles.
* *Automated*: Once started, the drawing is done completely by a untrusted network of computers without human intervention.
* *Transparent*: Anyone can check all participants and winners on the blockchain. The winner comes back to share his or her experience.
* *Decentralized*: Anyone can create a drawing, participate in a drawing, and verify the results.

FairPlay can spread by sharing links and QR codes via social networks. In the near future, you will also be able to browse or search for FairPlay drawings directly from your CMT Wallet.

The long term vision of the CyberMiles public blockchain is to support an ecosystem of smart contracts that faciliate buying or selling products. FairPlay is an early prototype of such a smart contract -- it lists and transacts e-commerce products / items in a decentralized fashion.
