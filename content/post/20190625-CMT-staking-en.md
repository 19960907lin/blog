CyberMiles App (formerly CMT Wallet) 3.0 is officially launched, and the mobile App staking CMT function is not enable! Now users can use the CyberMiles APP to stake their CMTs to validators (supernodes) to get block revenue. Come and download [here](http://onelink.to/v248ze)!


According to the current stake of the whole network, now that the stake 10,000 CMT, the compensation rate is 30%, the block income that can be obtained in one year is * CMTs. This data is calculated at the block height.

The block reward is affected by the total stake of the whole network, the validtadorâ€™s compensation rate, the  CMT stake amount, and the staking method being CMT Wallet or CMT Cube. You can see the expected award at the block browser CMTTracking.io (http://cmttracking. Io/) Use the [award calculator](https://www.cmttracking.io/nodes) to calculate the reward at a specific moment.


* Under the same conditions, the CMT Cube staking reward is 20% higher than the CMT Wallet (CyberMiles App).

### Block reward source: 


The system has an annual inflation rate of 8%. This inflation is distributed as newly minted CMTs to delegators.

The delegators also receive transaction fees paid by heavy users of the blockchain. 



### Precautions:


1. Using CyberMiles App The number of stakes per address is 1,000 to 100,000 CMTs, you can create multiple addresses for staking
2. Each address can only stake to on validator
3. You can choose to cancel the staking anytime, but the stake has a waiting time of about 8 days, and you still get reward during the waiting period. You will need to wait for another 7 days to withdraw the reward.
4. Users of CMT Cube can import the address of CMT Cube into CyberMiles APP, but please do not perform any staking operation on CMT Wallet. Once any staking is performed using CyberMiles APP, the system will determine that the address is a CyberMiles App address, and you lose the 20% higher reward bonus of the CMT Cube.
