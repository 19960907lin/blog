Q: Is there any chance for staking community to get a simple calculator for staked CMTs?
 
A: Yes. We have simplified computation. ROI depends on 2 factors: the amount of CMTs put on stake; the ratio of CMTs between cube and Wallet. 

There will be a simple calculator on CMT explorer to show real time ROI. Caculator comes with the new version of CMT Wallet.
