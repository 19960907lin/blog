Q:  Does the advantage of CyberMiles beat the inherent advantages of traditional players like eBay or Amazon?

A: Cheaper prices for buyers and more profit for sellers. Amazon has monopoly position on the market, therefore it has too strong a bargaining power rendering sellers and buyers vulnerable. In addition, the centralized Amazon make 40% of its profit out of the vast amount of data  the data it gathered from the users, which should belong to the users.  

Our peer-to-peer marketplace will be more diverse as well. It will be a self-governed marketplace with mediators from the community, which makes the ecosystem more wholesome and benefits all parties.
