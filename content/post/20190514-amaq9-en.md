Q:  Does the advantage of CyberMiles beat the inherent advantages of traditional players like eBay or Amazon?


A: Cheaper prices for buyers and more profit for sellers. Centralized Amazon take 40% of commission because of its monopoly position on the market. Also Amazon can monetized the data it gathered from the users, which should belong to the users. 

Our peer-to-peer marketplace will be more diverse as well. It will be a self-governed marketplace with mediators from the community, which makes the ecosystem more wholesome and benefits all parties.
