Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which builds, operates and advances global markets through information and technology, has added 58 leading cryptocurrencies to its crypto data feed, including the CyberMiles Token (CMT).


This move by ICE, which owns of 12 financial exchanges and marketplaces, including the storied New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), is a significant for [CMT](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CMT&src=ctag) because, in addition to NYSE, the company has invested heavily in Bakkt, purportedly “the first integrated, institutional grade exchange-traded markets and custody solution for physical delivery of digital assets.”


The crypto data feed service, which ICE and Blockstream launched together last year, is designed to facilitate price discovery and provide historic data of dozens of tokens and fiat currencies. Go to Chepicap for a full report.


### 2. “A blockchain to connect all blockchains,” Cosmos is officially live


Cosmos, the highly-anticipated network that is designed to improve blockchain interoperability, officially released its live software last week, [CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/a-blockchain-to-connect-all-blockchains-cosmos-is-now-officially-live) reported.


While users won’t be able to swap tokens between blockchains (or otherwise connect with existing blockchain networks) until validators vote to activate the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, the Cosmos Hub launch is a milestone: the first in a series of proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains within the Cosmos ecosystem.


For now, take a look back to [CyberMiles’ introduction of a blockchain explorer for Cosmos](https://medium.com/cybermiles/introducing-a-blockchain-explorer-for-cosmos-dc9136461ca1) with our very own [Dr. Michael Yuan]（https://twitter.com/juntao）.


### 3. A guide to consensus algorithms


Speaking of PoS blockchains, CoinGecko has a handy guide to a half dozen consensus algorithms used by the most notable — and promising — crypto projects around.


Chief among these is Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), which CyberMiles swears by and has been touted as [a potential game changer](https://hacked.com/future-of-dpos-in-three-projects-cybermiles-eos-and-tron/). But you don’t have to take our word for it; check out [part one](https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/coingecko-consensus-algorithms-guide-part-1?locale=en) and [part two](https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/coingecko-consensus-algorithms-guide-part-2?locale=en) of this guide for yourself.


### 4. The World Wide Web turns 30: favorite memories from A to Z

30 years ago this month, Tim Berners-Lee submitted a proposal entitled “Information Management” to his boss at the European physics laboratory, CERN.


It began by asking how future scientists would keep track of their increasingly large projects. “This proposal provides an answer to such questions,” Berners-Lee wrote.


The proposal described what, in just a couple years’ time, would transform into the World Wide Web: a connected system for sharing information that would revolutionize how the entire planet communicated.


Head over to [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/12/18259700/world-wide-wide-turns-30-www-anniversary-favorite-sites) for a full rundown.


### 5. ICYMI: CyberMiles’ Chief Scientist on the many uses of blockchain in business


As HackerNoon sums up, [Dr. Yuan](https://twitter.com/juntao) recently added his thoughts about blockchain technology’s extraordinary potential to provide value to businesses of all kinds. Rather than competing against each other, Dr. Yuan posits, “companies can collaborate and build a system with each business industry having its own chain.”
