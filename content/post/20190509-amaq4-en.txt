Q: Q: Have you got any vision of future cooperation between crypto (especially cmt) and fiat money? That's not a secret - fiat money won't die (if to proceed from Lindy's effect)
 
A: Fiat currency is critical for e-commerce and that is why we have a stable coin on CM; 
Another important use of cryptocurrency in e-commerce is to implement a rewards points system, which we will also do as part of e-commerce app; 
CMT itself is a utility token that powers the network itself, much like ETH’s role in Ethereum. Please refer to our whitepaper.
