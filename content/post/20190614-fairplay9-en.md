Smart contract safety is extremely important for DApps. The winner drawing of the FairPlay smart contract is based on a safe random number generated by CyberMiles Validators. The secure random number generator for smart contracts is a key innovation of CyberMiles.

CyberMiles has a strong technology partnership with [AnChain.ai](https://www.anchain.ai/), an AI-powered blockchain security firm. In 2018, AnChain.ai detected the first Blockchain APT (BAPT) hack in history: BAPT-FOMO3D that stole $4 millions worth of ETHs. BAPT-FOMO3D was a ground breaking discovery in blockchain security. 

The Blockchain APT Metal Arts were created to commemorate this event. It is a metal piece measuring 24 inches wide. Only 10 pieces were ever created. It is valued at $499. Now you have a chance to get one! The ART is the 9th giveaway of FairPlay 10-days campaign, sponsored by AnChain.ai.
