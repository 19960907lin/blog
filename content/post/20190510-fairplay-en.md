Mother’s Day is right around the corner. Are you ready for the celebration? **Win movie tickets for 2, and take your mom to a movie!**
 
Each winner will get a $25 AMC or Cinemark gift card — enough for two movie tickets. Please note that this offer is only available in the USA. Good luck!

### How does it work?
 
You can participate the drawing for free by downloading the [CMT Wallet mobile app]((https://www.cybermiles.io/en-us/blockchain-infrastructure/cmt-wallet/)), and entering your contact info.

The lucky winners will each get a $25 AMC or Cinemark gift card — enough for two movie tickets. [As we have discussed before](https://blog.cybermiles.io/post/20190502-fairplay-en/), the FairPlay DApp prize drawing is fair, fully automated, transparent, and decentralized.
