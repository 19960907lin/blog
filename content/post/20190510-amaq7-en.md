Q:  We know that you envision a future of asset digitalization. When do you think there will be massive development on this?

A: We know the long term trends are toward digitalization. We've seen over the years and decades a certain movement with the internet that we have decentralized technology, there is a real hunger for it. We see it in the financial sector, supply chain, and third-industries. We know that asset digitalization is a growing way, it's only a matter of time.
