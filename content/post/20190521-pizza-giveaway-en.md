FairPlay will choose 4 lucky winners, and give away Domino's pizza gift cards ($15 each) on May 22nd!

May 22nd is known as the Bitcoin Pizza Day. On that day, we celebrate the most “expensive” pizza bought in human history!

On May 22nd 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz, a computer programmer in Florida, paid a Bitcoin Talk forum user 10,000 BTC to get two pizzas. In today's Bitcoin value, he paid more than $400 million US Dollars for each pizza. 

Bitcoin was born in 2009, a time when most people, even the early adopters, didn't recognize its value. Laszlo Hanyecz's pizza story is a good example. Bitcoin was worth less than a penny when Laszlo Hanyecz bought the pizzas. 9 years later, Bitcoin is worth $8000 USD today. 

As bitcoin gains prominence and value, May 22nd has become a special day of significance.
