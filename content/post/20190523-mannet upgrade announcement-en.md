CyberMiles mainnet upgraded to v0.1.8-beta

CyberMiles mainnet has sucessfully upgraded without forking occurring on 23th May, following validators' vote. After this upgrade to the version v0.1.8-beta, the validator and delegator block rewards will be easier to understand and calculate. 

The CyberMiles Mainnet now allows CMT holders to use CMT Wallet to stake;

With this upgrade, the loyalty (the second factor) and diversity of delegators (the third) factors in the staking rewards calculation cancelled, meaning whenever a CMT holder starts to stake, he get a same block reward with the same amount of CMTs over a same period of time under the same validator. This will be more equal for all delegators. Meanwhile the delegator can change validators with no qualms.





During the last upgrade (v0.1.7-beta), the non-linear factor of short-term stake increase's rewards factor was cancelled. Coupled with this time's cancellation of loyalty and diversity factor, the block rewards formula will be linear, i.e. the staking reward amount will only be affected by the staked CMTs amount. With more staked CMTs comes more block rewards porportionately. 





Another goal for this upgrade is to enable the staking API for CMT Wallet, therefore CMT Wallet can be used by CMT holders to stake and help manage CyberMiles network to gain block reward. 



As long as the CMT Wallet mobile app's new version development is completed, CMT holders will be allowed to acheive these with the mobile app.
