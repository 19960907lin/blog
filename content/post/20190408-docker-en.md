### TL;DR 

If you use Docker to run a CyberMiles node, please make sure that you turn on the `priviledged` Docker option: 

```
docker run --privileged --name travis -v $HOME/.travis:/travis -t -p 26657:26657 cybermiles/travis:v0.1.7-beta node start --home /travis
```

Read on to find out how to run a node for the CyberMiles [testnet](https://travis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/connect-testnet.html#option-1-docker-from-a-snapshot) or the [mainnet](https://travis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/connect-mainnet.html#option-1-docker-from-snapshot).

### The long story

One of the key technology innovations from the CyberMiles public blockchain is 
the [libENI](https://www.litylang.org/performance/) dynamic extension. It allows application developers 
to add high performance native functions to the virtual machine without stopping or forking the blockchain. 
Developers write new functions in native C/C++ code as libENI modules. CyberMiles validators vote and determine whether to
include any newly created libENI modules on the blockchain. Once included, those native functions become available to 
all smart contracts deployed on the CyberMiles public blockchain. 

However, a potential issue for libENI is that third party native code could expose the blockchain nodes to attacks or bugs.
The burden is on the CyberMiles validators to review third party submitted libENI module source code, and determine whether 
the code is up to our network safty and performance standards. That requires a high level of technical expertise. That is
why CyberMiles validators have so far been reluctant to approve new third party libENI extension modules.

With the [CyberMiles v0.1.7-beta software update](https://github.com/CyberMiles/travis/releases/tag/v0.1.7-beta), 
we have added a sandbox for the libENI modules to ensure that the native code would not crash the underlying system. 
The sandnox requires the Docker container to run in a `priviledged` mode in order to use [seccomp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seccomp) (secure computing mode).

For all CyberMiles validators and full node operators (e.g., exchanges), please make sure that you always use the 
`docker run --privileged` command option.
