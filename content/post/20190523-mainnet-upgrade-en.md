CyberMiles mainnet was sucessfully upgraded without forking on 23th May, following validators' vote. With this upgrade to the version 0.1.8-beta, CyberMiles validator and delegator block rewards will be easier to understand and calculate. In addition, the CyberMiles Mainnet now allows CMT holders to use CMT Wallet to stake.


### Cancelling the loyalty and diversity factor in reward calculation

With this upgrade, the loyalty (the second factor) and diversity of delegators (the third) factors in the staking rewards calculation cancelled, meaning whenever a CMT holder starts to stake, he get a same block reward with the same amount of CMTs over a same period of time under the same validator. This will be more equal for all delegators. Meanwhile the delegator can change validators with no qualms.





During the last upgrade (v0.1.7-beta), the non-linear factor of short-term stake increase's rewards factor was cancelled. Coupled with this time's cancellation of loyalty and diversity factor, the block rewards formula will be linear, i.e. the staking reward amount will only be affected by the staked CMTs amount. With more staked CMTs comes more block rewards porportionately. 




### Allow CMT Wallet to stake

Another goal for this upgrade is to enable the staking API for CMT Wallet, therefore CMT Wallet can be used by CMT holders to stake and help manage CyberMiles network to gain block reward. 


As long as the CMT Wallet mobile app's new version development is completed, CMT holders will be allowed to acheive these with the mobile app.


For Cube owners, there will be a higher staking reward to stake with Cubes for the time being.
