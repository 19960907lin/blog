Q:  Can you clear some doubts about CyberMiles' Cooperation with Google?

A: At the early stage of cooperation, CyberMiles jumped the gun in announcing the news on our own Twitter, before Google authorized it, which made google not very happy.

The cooperation timeline is still being reviewed at Google's headquarter. We don't have an answer about this. Google had commissioned and paid for the project.

When the news come out, the cooperation was widely reported by many media news channels. Because it is true, so you can still find those articles about the cooperation by searching on Google.
