Two Third (2/3) of all CyberMiles Validators have voted on 28th of October, 2019 to agree on the proposal to upgrade the MainNet software to v0.1.10-beta. The CyberMiles Foundation and CyberMiles validators have voted to perform an upgrade to the MainNet software at block height 2875555, which is approximately between 12:00-14:00 (GMT+8) on Oct 30th 2019. 

  The upgrade addresses the following issues:

* It allows all users to cleanly unstake and have all funds available for withdraw within 8 days.
* The CyberMiles Virtual Machine now supports JSON parsing in smart contracts — a crucial feature for e-commerce applications. This is the first time an Ethereum compatible virtual machine provides JSON support.

During the upgrade, the CyberMiles mainnet will stop, therefore all services on the CyberMiles blockchain will also pause until it resumes when 2/3 validators have started the new software.

CyberMiles App, browser [CMTtracking](https://www.cmttracking.io/), CMT Cube will have a pause on service since the data on the chain is not queried. After the mainnet is upgraded, the service will resume. The process won’t affect your CMT assets.

Meanwhile, in order to coordinate this upgrade, the exchanges will paunse CMT deposits and withdrawals around 12th Oct 2019,11:30 GMT+8 until the upgraded software resumes producing blocks. Please be aware of the exchanges announcement on CMT deposits and withdrawals pause and resuming time.

Thanks!
